Hi! 

Thanks for using this template, to finish the setup please follow these steps:

######## APP NAME: ########

* Change the name of this project following the correct syntax:
* Type of API:
   - sapi: System API
   - papi: Process API
   - xapi: Experience API
   
 * Name of the API:
   - all lower case
   - no special characters, only a-z and 0-9
   - No spaces, use dashes
   - Be as descriptive as possible about what the API does
   
 * Examples:
 	- sapi-salesforce-database-access
 	- xapi-web-portal-user-login  


######## ENCRYPTION: ########

* Create a 128bits encryption key: https://www.allkeysgenerator.com/Random/Security-Encryption-Key-Generator.aspx
* Declare the variable "mule.vault.key=ENCRYPTIONKEY" (no quotes) as an argument
* DO NOT put the encryption key in any file on the project. Once deployed declare the encryption key variable on CloudHub
* NO NOT commit the encryption key.
* Encrypt any value on the secure.XXX.yaml files using the "secure-properties-tool.jar" file (not included on this template)
* Remember to declare the same variable @ CircleCI and Runtime.

######## HTTPS / TLS: ########

* Create the keystore.jks file using the pkcs12 format
* Move the file to the src/main/resources folder on the project
* Configure HTTP and TLS using the keystore
* DONT put the keystore password on any file, use arguments and variables on runtime. 

######## CIRCLE CI: ########

Take a moment to update the pom.xml file and update the following items:
* Anypoint Platform Bussines group ID (line 47)
* Encryption Key VARIABLE name that should be declared in circle CI (line 59)
* Anypoint Platform Client ID and Secret VARIABLE name that should be declared in circle CI. (lines 66 and 67)

Open the .circleci/config.xml file and edit the name of application to match with the one you setup before.
* Replace the lines " # APPLICATION_NAME: CONFIGURE-ME" with  APPLICATION_NAME: sapi-muletemplate for example. Yes, remove the hashtag



Thanks!
